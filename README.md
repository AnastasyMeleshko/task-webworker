# task-01

1) Create a hover-based drop-down menu with 3 items without using JavaScript. This can be achieved using CSS hover selectors and appropriate styling.
2) Implement a custom select functionality using checkboxes without relying on JavaScript.
   By using CSS and the `:checked` pseudo-class, you can create a visually styled select menu that responds to checkbox selections.
4) Demonstrate four examples of animations:
- keyframes with built-in animations;
- keyframes with custom animations;
- requestAnimationFrame();
- setTimeout with recursion

To organize your project, use Webpack as the build tool to bundle your JavaScript and SCSS for styles. 
Implement the DDD (Domain-Driven Design) approach for folder structure.
